# Sudoku_Solver
Let this program solve your sudoku for you or tell you if it's impossible to solve.

Pull the code and run make in the folder with the make file.

Modify any of the .dat files as necessary to match your sudoku.

You may want to change the main.cpp a bit as well since this was originally for an assignment.

Happy solving!
